## Description

This repository contains my work on a series of NestJS exercises completed as part of my coursework at INSAT University (RT4 program). The exercises focus on building a robust backend application using NestJS, TypeORM, and various advanced concepts.

## Overview

The project covers the following:

- Implementation of a Todo management system.
- Usage of TypeORM for database interactions.
- Implementation of a middleware to simulate authentication using JWT.
- Creation of a small CV management system with associated relations.
